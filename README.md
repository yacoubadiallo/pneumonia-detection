# pneumonia-detection
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect pneumonia from chest X-rays. The model classifies images into "Pneumonia" and "Normal" categories. Built with TensorFlow and Keras, the model aims to assist radiologists by automating diagnosis and improving accuracy. Data preprocessing and model training are included.
